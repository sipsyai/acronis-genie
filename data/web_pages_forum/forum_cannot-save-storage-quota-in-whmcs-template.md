            Yes, I had already created a ticket.
 
The issue must be due to the latest version of WHMCS 8.1.0 because it wasn't an issue in the previous version afaik,

            I found this was an odd issue from any of the following causing it
 
litespeed
PHP selector
PHP 7.4
possibly because of  custom.htaccess above public_html which did not match server enviroment.
 
I did so many changes and not 100% sure what corrected it, and not looking to go back through it all again, but got there in the end. Works fine now.
